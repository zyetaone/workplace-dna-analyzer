# Instructions for Setting Up OpenAI API Key

## IMPORTANT: Do this yourself for security!

1. Create or edit your `.env` file (NOT .env.example)
2. Add this line:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
3. Make sure `.env` is in your `.gitignore` file
4. Never commit the `.env` file to version control

## To verify .env is ignored:
Run: `git status`
The .env file should NOT appear in the list

## Security Best Practices:
- Rotate your API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development and production
- Set spending limits in your OpenAI dashboard
- Monitor usage regularly

## For Production:
Use environment variables in your hosting platform instead of .env files
