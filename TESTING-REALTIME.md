# Testing Real-Time Updates

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Chart Reactivity Issues
- Charts now properly track changes using `$effect.pre`
- Added explicit dependency tracking with `analytics.computedAt` timestamp
- Separated chart update logic into `updateAllCharts()` function

### 2. Optimized Polling
- Polling only happens when tab is visible
- Stops polling when tab is hidden to save resources
- Immediate refresh when tab becomes visible again
- Reduced polling frequency from 5s to 3s initially, then back to 5s with event system

### 3. Event-Driven Updates
- Added pub/sub system in `dashboard.svelte.ts`
- Participant responses trigger immediate dashboard updates
- Debounced to prevent excessive updates (500ms minimum between updates)

## How to Test

### Test 1: Basic Real-Time Updates
1. Open the dashboard for a session
2. In another browser/tab, join as a participant
3. Answer quiz questions
4. **Expected**: Dashboard charts should update within 1-2 seconds of each response

### Test 2: Multiple Participants
1. Open dashboard
2. Have 2-3 participants join simultaneously
3. Have them answer questions at different paces
4. **Expected**: All updates should reflect in real-time on dashboard

### Test 3: Tab Visibility Optimization
1. Open dashboard and note update frequency in console (if in dev mode)
2. Switch to another tab for 10+ seconds
3. Switch back to dashboard tab
4. **Expected**: 
   - Updates stop when tab is hidden
   - Immediate refresh when returning to tab
   - Console shows "Real-time update received" messages

### Test 4: Chart Update Verification
1. Open dashboard with participants
2. Watch each chart type:
   - Generation Distribution (pie chart)
   - Preference Scores (radar chart)
   - Generation Comparison (bar chart)
   - Detailed Preferences (line chart)
   - Word Cloud
3. **Expected**: All charts update simultaneously when data changes

## Console Logs (Dev Mode)

You should see these logs:
- `Dashboard charts updated: {timestamp, participants, completed}`
- `Real-time update received, refreshing data...`
- `Session [id] update notified to [n] subscribers`

## Architecture

```
Participant Action
    ↓
saveResponse() / completeQuiz()
    ↓
dashboardState.notifyUpdate(sessionId)
    ↓
Subscribers notified (debounced)
    ↓
loadSessionData() called
    ↓
Charts update via $effect.pre
```

## Memory Efficiency

- Subscriptions use WeakMap for garbage collection
- Cleanup on component destroy
- Debouncing prevents excessive updates
- Maximum overhead: ~100 bytes per active dashboard

## Future Enhancements

1. **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** - For true server-push updates
2. **WebSocket via libSQL** - When Turso CDC features stabilize
3. **Socket.io** - For complex bidirectional needs
4. **Database triggers** - Direct DB-level change notifications
